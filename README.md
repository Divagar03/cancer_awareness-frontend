Cancer Awareness & Support

A simple, responsive static page with a contact form (no backend).

Files
- `index.html` — landing page with banner and contact form
- `styles.css` — responsive layout and styling
- `script.js` — simple front-end form validation and feedback

How to run
1. Open the folder in your browser or run from PowerShell:

```powershell
# from the project folder
Start-Process .\index.html
```

Notes
- The contact form does not send data to a server; it validates and shows a local confirmation message.
- The banner uses an Unsplash image URL; replace with a local image if you prefer.
